## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (for running the `.m` files)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mincasurong/CT-Expert-system-Fuzzy.git
    cd CT-Expert-system-Fuzzy
    ```

2. Open the desired `.m` file in MATLAB and run it to execute the continuous-time fuzzy logic expert system.

### Example

To run the main simulation script:
1. Open `Main_simulation.m` in MATLAB.
2. Run the script to see the continuous-time fuzzy logic expert system in action.

## Continuous-Time Fuzzy Logic Expert System

The expert system uses continuous-time fuzzy logic to make intelligent decisions based on continuous input data. Fuzzy logic allows the system to handle uncertainty and imprecision, making it suitable for complex real-time decision-making tasks.

### Key Features

- **Continuous-Time Fuzzy Logic**: Utilizes continuous-time fuzzy logic rules for decision making.
- **Membership Functions**: Implements Gaussian membership functions.
- **Real-Time Application**: Designed for real-time applications requiring continuous data input and processing.
